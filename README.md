## 💡 2. Executive Summary

> **🚨 The Problem:** 
> Pakistani households face soaring electricity costs without a clear understanding of which appliances contribute most to their monthly bills. Traditional utility bills provide a total payable amount, but lack granular, actionable insights into daily consumption patterns.

> **✅ Our Solution:** 
> Bijli Bachat AI is a smart energy optimizer dashboard. It empowers users to estimate appliance-level energy consumption, extract billing data automatically via AI OCR, and receive personalized, AI-driven strategies to reduce their energy footprint and optimize monthly utility costs.

## 🎯 3. Target Audience

* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Primary Users:** Household managers and residents in Pakistan actively seeking ways to monitor and reduce monthly utility expenses.
* 🌱 **Secondary Users:** Environmentally conscious individuals aiming to track and minimize their household's carbon footprint.

---

## ⭐ 4. Core Features (MVP Scope)

### 📄 Smart Bill Data Extraction (AI OCR)
* **Functionality:** Users upload images (PNG, JPG) or PDFs of their electricity bills.
* **Tech:** Integrates **Google Gemini AI** to securely scan and extract `bill_amount_pkr` and `units_kwh` automatically.

### 🔌 Interactive Appliance Energy Audit
* **Functionality:** A dynamic calculator for estimating monthly energy usage.
* **Tech:** Users can add up to 25 appliances (Watts, Hours used, Quantity). The system dynamically calculates estimated monthly kWh and total PKR cost.

### 📊 Energy Snapshot & Trend Alerts
* **Functionality:** A real-time comparative dashboard.
* **Tech:** Calculates percentage changes between current and previous months. Triggers auto-color-coded UI alerts (🟢 Success, 🟡 Warning, 🔴 Critical) for sudden consumption spikes.

### 🤖 Agentic AI Energy Specialists
* **Functionality:** 4 specialized prompt-based AI modules:
  1. **Understanding Agent:** Summarizes the energy profile.
  2. **Energy Analysis Agent:** Identifies heavy consumption drivers.
  3. **Saving Strategy Agent:** Recommends high-impact, low-cost practical savings.
  4. **Monitoring Agent:** Suggests specific usage thresholds for the next month.

### 💬 Floating Energy AI Assistant
* **Functionality:** An omnipresent chat interface. Maintains conversational context, allowing users to ask specific queries (e.g., *"How can I reduce AC consumption?"*) based on their localized data.

### 🌱 Carbon Footprint Estimator
* **Functionality:** Calculates estimated CO₂ emissions (kg CO₂e/month) using an illustrative grid conversion factor to promote eco-friendly habits.

---

## ⚙️ 5. Technical Architecture

* **Frontend:** Built with `Streamlit`. Features custom CSS for strict dual-theme (Light/Dark) consistency, ensuring professional rendering of sidebars and metrics regardless of user system settings.
* **Backend Data:** Handled via `Python` & `Pandas` for dynamic dataframe creation, filtering, and mathematical aggregations.
* **AI Layer:** Google `genai` SDK utilizing lightweight LLM models (Gemini Flash) for OCR extraction and role-based prompt engineering.
